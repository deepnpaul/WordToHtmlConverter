# WordToHtmlConverter
This project is an ASP.NET Core MVC application that allows users to upload Word documents (.docx) and convert them into editable HTML content. The converted HTML can be viewed, edited, stored in a database, and exported as a PDF. The application utilizes Open XML SDK, PuppeteerSharp, and SQL Server for seamless document processing and storage.
